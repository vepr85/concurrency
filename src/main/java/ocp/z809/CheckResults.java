/**
 * How many times will the while()loop in this code execute and output Not reached
 yet? The answer is, we donâ€™t know! It could output zero, ten, or a million times. If our
 thread scheduler is particularly poor, it could operate infinitely! Using a while()loop to
 check for data without some kind of delay is considered a very bad coding practice as it
 ties up CPU resources for no reason.
